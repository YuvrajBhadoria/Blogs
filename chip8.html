            <h2 class="headIntro">Introduction</h2>
            <p  id = "para" class="intro">
                Few weeks back i completed my Chip-8 Project , it was fun and learned a lot as i learned how power an
                array
                could be .
                It was challlenging as a begineer to understand the documentation of it but somehow i managed to feed it
                in my
                brain. I also learned
                how Simple DirectMedia Layer 3(SDL3) and how important is logging(The Function which show if an error
                has
                occured)

                In addition i would say it was fun to learn how Emulation actually works.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="headArray">Takeaway From Array</h2>
            <p  id = "para" class="array">
                One of the big takeaways was just how powerful arrays really were. They seemed like a basic container to
                hold
                data in, but by the time I was using them to represent things like RAM, the stack, and even instructions
                themselves, it clicked, arrays were
                the basis for everything: every instruction Chip-8 would fetch and decode from memory stored in an
                array, the
                stack was just
                another array handling return addresses, even the registers could be thought of as a small array of
                values. It
                was like arrays
                quietly controlled the entire emulation behind the scenes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="headSDL">Simple DirectMedia Layer 3(SDL3)</h2>
            <p  id = "para" class="SDL">
                Then came SDL, which really made me appreciate the more graphical side of things. I did my rendering of
                the
                Chip-8
                display in SDL3, and after realizing how it works, it did a pretty smooth job. But the best part was to
                see this
                emulator finally come to life: tiny pixels flickering into shapes and animations. For drawing pixels, I
                used XOR
                logic,
                and that was interesting: instead of just turning pixels on or off, XOR would flip them , if a pixel was
                already
                on,
                it turned off, creating that classic Chip-8 “sprite flicker” effect. A simple trick, but kind of magical
                when it
                finally
                worked.

            <h2 class="headLogging">How Important Logging Is</h2>
            <p  id = "para" class="logging">
                Logging also proved to be a lifesaver. Early on, I had a frustrating problem in which sound wasn't
                playing
                properly,
                and I had absolutely no clue what was going wrong. The moment I started to log every little function
                call and
                error,
                finally I could see where the problem was hiding. It turned out my sound flag wasn't being updated
                properly ,something
                I would have missed if those logs didn't show where exactly, and why, it failed.

            <h2 class="headSound">Implimenting Audio</h2>
            <p  id = "para" class="sound">
                Sound implementation itself was another challenge. Getting that to work every frame while keeping timing
                correct
                took a
                few late nights and plenty of “why isn't this working” moments. But, finally, hearing that first short
                beep 
                the real
                Chip-8 sound was incredibly satisfying.

            <h2 class="headSummary">Summary</h2>
            <p id = "para"  class="summarry">
                In the end, this emulator taught me much more than just technical stuff: it showed me how small concepts
                like arrays,
                bitwise operations, and simple APIs can go together to recreate surprisingly complex things. And that
                feeling seeing
                your code give life to something makes all struggles totally worth it.
